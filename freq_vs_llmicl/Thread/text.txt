🚀 Did you know you can use the in-context learning abilities of an LLM to estimate the transition probabilities of a dynamical system like Markov chains?

The results are pretty exciting ! 😄

What’s even better is that you can derive bounds on the estimation error based on the number of samples N provided and specific properties of the Markov chain. Tested and validated on recent LLMs!

💡 Cool point to note:

Consider a Markov chain with d states. The LLM-based method achieves an error rate of O(log⁡(d)/N), compared to the frequentist approach, which is minimax optimal and achieves O(d/N) (see Wolfer et al., 2019, https://proceedings.mlr.press/v98/wolfer19a/wolfer19a.pdf), 

This makes it particularly efficient for Markov chains with a large number of states! 🌟
