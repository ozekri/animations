ðŸš€ Did you know you can use the in-context learning abilities of an LLM to estimate the transition probabilities of a dynamical system like Markov chains?

The results are pretty exciting ! ðŸ˜„

For more details, check out these papers:

ðŸ‘‰ [arXiv:2402.00795](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00795) â€” Introduces this method (to the best of my knowledge).  
ðŸ‘‰ [arXiv:2410.02724](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02724) â€” Provides theoretical results and empirical validation on LLMs.
